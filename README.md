### Collaborating: Git Workflow

This repository has 2 branches:
- `master`
- `development`

All development should be done on the `development` branch. When working on features, branch from `development` into a new branch - `feature` - and make a pull request back to the `development` branch when complete.

The `master` branch should be reserved for working releases.
