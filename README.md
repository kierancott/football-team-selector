### Collaborating: Git Workflow

This repository has 4 branches:
- `master`
- `development`
- `frontend-development`
- `backend-development`

All work on the React frontend should be done on the `frontend-development` branch, and branches should be made from the `frontend-development` branch for individual frontend features.

All work on the Laravel API backend should be done on the `backend-development` branch, and branches should be made from the `backend-development` branch for individual backend features.

Work on test builds with both the frontend and backend should be done in `development`, into which working versions of `frontend-development` and `backend-development` are to be merged

The `master` branch should be reserved for working releases.
